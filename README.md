Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet

<img> https://github.com/femiode01/earthquake_usgs/blob/master/images/usgs.png

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes in the last 7 days from the United States Geological Survey GeoJSON Feed page. This data will allow USGS to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.
